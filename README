An attempt to place some scripts from my website adp-gmbh.ch
under source control.

/blob_wrapper
    A small package used to write blobs to a file and
    read files into blob.
  
/bmp
    A small package that can create simple bitmaps 
    drawn unto a blob.

/desc_table
    A package to find information about tables.
   (Primary keys, column-comments etc).
    This package is used for the script
   /sqlpath/desc.sql
 

/sqlpath
    The folder sqlpath contains scripts that are supposed to 
    be called from SQL*Plus. Therefore, they should go
    to a directory that the environement variable SQLPATH
    points to. Usually the login.sql script goes there, too.


/trace_file
    A package to read previously dumped trace file
   (such as those created by the 10046 event)
